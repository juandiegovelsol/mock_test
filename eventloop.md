Here's a brief explanation of how the event loop in Node.js works and how callbacks fit into the event-driven, non-blocking architecture:

The Node.js event loop is a fundamental concept for understanding asynchronous operations in Node.js. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations efficiently. Here's how it works:

**Event Queue:** Node.js maintains an event queue where asynchronous tasks (such as file I/O, network requests, timers) are placed when they are completed.

**Event Loop:** The event loop continuously checks the event queue for tasks. If a task is present, it's picked up and executed.

**Callback Functions:** Callback functions are a crucial part of this process. When you initiate an asynchronous operation (e.g., reading a file), you provide a callback function that will be executed when the operation is complete. This allows Node.js to continue executing other code without waiting for the operation to finish.

Non-Blocking: Since Node.js is single-threaded, blocking operations can slow it down. By using callbacks and the event loop, Node.js can efficiently handle multiple operations concurrently, making it non-blocking and highly performant.

## Callback Hell (Callback Pyramid)

Callback hell occurs when you have deeply nested callback functions, making the code hard to read and maintain. To mitigate this issue, you can use techniques like Promises or async/await:

`Promises`: Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. You can chain them using .then() and handle errors with .catch(), making the code more linear and readable.

`async/await`: async/await is built on top of Promises and further simplifies asynchronous code. You can write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, improving code readability.
